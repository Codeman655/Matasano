To test this solution, simply run r-xor-encrypt.rb followed by the key and the
plaintext that will be "encrypted."

A quick note is that the command is not configured to handle a file of plaintext
to encrypt. I was testing on a Unix system so to get the command to correctly handle
newlines. To test this, I used "cat" to output the contents of the file into the command line.

r-xor-encrypt.rb
